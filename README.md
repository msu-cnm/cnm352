# CNM352 Lab Files

This repository contains files for CNM 352 Labs.  These files will be automatically downloaded to the Kali Linux VM in NetLab into the folder `~/cnm352-labs` and can be viewed with Typora on Kali.  This will allow for easier copy/pasting of commands.

## WARNING FOR SAVING FILES

A template lab report is provided in this folder that can be used during your lab but BE SURE to copy it somewhere safe (like using https://cl1p.net/ to save it on your local machine) before ending the reservation as this file will not be saved.

Also note that any changes made in the `~/cnm352-labs` subfolders (including the `documentation` or `scripts` folders) on Kali will be discarded automatically on reboot.  The files inside the main `~/cnm352-labs` folder will be safe until you end the reservation.
