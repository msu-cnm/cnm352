### recon-ng

Module-based framework for web-based information gathering. Recon-ng displays the results of a module to the terminal but it also stores them in a database. Much of the power of recon-ng lies in feeding the results of one module into another, allowing us to quickly expand the scope of our information gathering. 

Start recon-ng to enter the recon-ng shell menu:

```bash
recon-ng
```

#### Modules

Added from the recon-ng "Marketplace":

```bash
marketplace search KEYWORD
```

Learn more about a particular module:

```bash
marketplace info MODULE_PATH
```

Some of the entries here have a '*' in the 'K' column, indicating they require credentials or API keys for third-party providers, which recon-ng provides some of, but some require free or paid accounts.

Install a module from the marketplace:

```bash
marketplace install MODULE_PATH	
```

Load a module:

```bash
modules load MODULE_PATH
```

Loading a module will take you into a sub-prompt for that module.  To see the available options for the loaded module:

```bash
info
```

To set the options for a loaded module:

```bash
options set OPTION_NAME VALUE
# Note: the default option for the SOURCE option is the local database.
```

After setting options, to execute the module:

```bash
run
```

Exit out of a module:

```bash
back
```

#### Stored Data

Recon-ng gathers information that it finds and stores it in a local database.  To view this database:

```bash
# Shows all available framework items
show

# Shows a particular item
show ITEM
```
