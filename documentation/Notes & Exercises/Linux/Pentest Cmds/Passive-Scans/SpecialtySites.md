#### Security Headers (Server Hardening Check)

https://securityheaders.com/

server via configuration. This includes things like disabling unneeded services,
removing unused services or user accounts, rotating default passwords, setting appropriate server headers, and so forth. We don’t need to know all the ins and outs of configuring every type of server, but understanding the concepts and what to look for can help when analyzing servers to determine how best to approach a potential target.
