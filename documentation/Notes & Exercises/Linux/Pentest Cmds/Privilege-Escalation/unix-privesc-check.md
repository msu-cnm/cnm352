## Unix-PrivEsc-Check

Automated enumeration script by pentestmonkey

https://github.com/pentestmonkey/unix-privesc-check

### Warning

Unique configurations can cause inaccurate results with automated scanners, so be aware of these setups and use manual scanning when necessary. 

### Documentation

```bash
Usage: unix-privesc-check { standard | detailed }

# "standard" mode: Speed-optimised check of lots of security settings.

# "detailed" mode: Same as standard mode, but also checks perms of open file handles and called files (e.g. parsed from shell scripts, linked .so files). This mode is slow and prone to false positives but might help you find more subtle flaws in 3rd party programs.

# This script checks file permissions and other settings that could allow local users to escalate privileges.
```

### Examples

```bash
# Run a standard scan and output to a file
./unix-privesc-check standard > output.txt

# Check for writeable files found, giving 8 lines after each match
grep "writable config" -A 8 output.txt
```
