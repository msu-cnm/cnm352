## ProxyChains

Allows use of SOCKS4 proxy with any tool.

Usage:

```bash
sudo proxychains COMMAND_AND_OPTIONS
```

Configuration found in `/etc/proxychains.conf`

### Performance Boost

Modify these values in `/etc/proxychains.conf`

```bash
tcp_read_time_out 100	# Default is 15000ms / 15sec
tcp_connect_time_out 100 # Default is 8000ms / 8sec
```

### nmap Scans - segmentation fault

When I performed certain types of scans like Script or Version scanning through Proxychains, I was getting a 'segmentation fault' error if certain protocols were present, like RPC.  

To fix this error, I simply modified `/etc/proxychains.conf` and commented out the `proxy_dns` option, as suggested by some forums, and I no longer had the issue.  

You can see what is actually causing the issue with the `dmesg` command.

Some things I tried that didn't fix it were:

- Disabling Name resolution on nmap with `-n`
- Updating liblua:  sudo apt install liblua5.2-0
- Updating proxychains:  sudo apt install proxychains
- Updating libproxychains:  sudo apt install libproxychains3
- Using proxychains4 (aka proxychains-ng) - this actually had other errors
