## SearchSploit - Exploit Database search utility

This tool searches Exploitdb.com and allows the download of offline copies of the exploits found.  This is provided by default in Kali distros.

### Install & Updating

Install with:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y install exploitdb
```

Make sure to update your package to get the most up to date archives:

```bash
searchsploit -u
```

### Storage

- Files are stored in `/usr/share/exploitdb/` 

- The exploits directory divides exploits by OS, architecture, and scripting language.

### Searching

Use the searchsploit utility to search through the archives and display results based on search terms

```bash
# Search for an exploit by keyword(s)
searchsploit [options] term1 term2...
-w	# Show URL's to Exploit-DB.com rather than the local path
-t	# Search JUST the xploit title (default is title and file's path)

# Examples
searchsploit remote smb microsoft windows
```

#### Strict Searches

By default, searchsploit does fuzzy searching to match related items, but for multiple terms this can produce a lot of irrelevant results.  To make it use exactly the terms specified, use the strict search option:

```bash
searchsploit -s TERM1 TERM2
```

#### Exclude terms:

```bash
searchsploit TERM --exclude="NOTHIS|ORTHIS|THISEITHER"
```



### Preview an Exploit

To see details on an exploit:

```bash
searchsploit -x NAME/NUMBER
```

### Picking an Exploit

Use searchsploit to mirror the exploit:

```bash
searchsploit -m NAME/NUMBER

# Options
# You can specify the exploit by its number (no extension) or the path to the code
```
