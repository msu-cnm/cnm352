## Upgrading Shells

Once a non-interactive shell is obtained, try these to upgrade it to a fully interactive shell, with prompts and tab completion.

### Quick & Easy

This is the easiest method, but relies on Python being installed.

```python
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

### Alternative Option

These commands basically give your reverse shell the ability to function like a normal bash shell, with tab autocompletions and all that.  In order to do this, you have to be creative and bypass the local shell to send the raw commands to the remote shell (I believe is what is happening)

```bash
SHELL=/bin/bash script -q /dev/null
CTRL+Z
stty raw -echo
#After typing the above, you won't see the next thing you type
fg
reset
xterm
#Press 'ENTER' a couple of times to get the prompt back
```

Explanation:

```bash
SHELL=/bin/bash script -q /dev/null  # Sets remote shell to use bash, but tells it to remain hidden
# Options
SHELL=/bin/bash		# Sets the shell to BASH
script -q /dev/null	# script #Creates a typescript of all the commands and results in a file
					-q #be quiet (do not write start and done messages to standard output).
					/dev/null #sets file location to /dev/null, so the results will not be written anywhere

CTRL+Z			 	# to background the netcat session

stty raw -echo	# Tell the local shell not to process special characters so they are sent to the remote session and to not display the commands typed
# Options
stty 			# sets options for the terminal
raw 			# input and output is not processed, just sent straight through. Processing can be things like ignoring certain characters, translating characters into other characters, allowing interrupt signals etc. So with stty raw you can't hit Ctrl-C to end a process, for example.
-echo 			# dash means "disable" a setting, so it disables echoing (printing to the terminal).  Without this, all typed characters will appear twice

fg	#bring netcat process back to foreground
reset	# initializes the terminal, the prompt will be janky, but just keep typing
xterm	# sets terminal type to X windows terminal
```
