## Linux Enumeration Scripts

### Bash

- LinEnum
  
  - https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum
  
    ```bash
    # Example
    ./LinEnum.sh -s -k keyword -r report -e /tmp/ -t
    
    # Options
        -k Enter keyword
        -e Enter export location
        -t Include thorough (lengthy) tests
        -s Supply current user password to check sudo perms (INSECURE)
        -r Enter report name
        -h Displays this help text
    
    Running with no options = limited scans/no output file
    
        -e Requires the user enters an output location i.e. /tmp/export. If this location does not exist, it will be created.
        -r Requires the user to enter a report name. The report (.txt file) will be saved to the current working directory.
        -t Performs thorough (slow) tests. Without this switch default 'quick' scans are performed.
        -s Use the current user with supplied password to check for sudo permissions - note this is insecure and only really for CTF use!
        -k An optional switch for which the user can search for a single keyword within many files (documented below).
