## RPCclient

pcclient is a utility initially developed  to test MS-RPC functionality in Samba itself. It has undergone several  stages of development and stability. Many system administrators have now written scripts around it to manage Windows NT clients from their UNIX  workstation.

```bash
rpcclient -U "" -N SERVER

# Options
-U username 	# use "" to use anonymous
```

RPCclient commands once connected:

```bash
# enumerate user command, and you can see the usernames as well as their RID (the suffix of their SID) in hexadecimal form.
enumdomusers

# Show details of a specific user
queryuser HEX_ID
```
