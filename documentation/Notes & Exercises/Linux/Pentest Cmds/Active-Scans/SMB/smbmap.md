### Misc

Future Brandon,

I made this regex to strip out share names of Readable shares so I could list those shares, but then I found an option that did it for you, so here's this in case it's needed for something else.  ~Past Brandon 

```bash
smbmap -H 10.11.1.231 | grep READ | sed 's/^\t\(\w*\D\?\).*$/\1/'
```
