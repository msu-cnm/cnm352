## NetDiscover

This tool will passively monitor ARP responses in the broadcast domain and record the IP and MAC addresses.  

```bash
# auto scan, passive scanning
sudo netdiscover
```

It can also actively scan by generating forged ARP requests to all IPs in a range.  These forged ARP requests will appear to originate from the IP address `x.x.x.67`, based on the network range it was given, regardless of the IP actually making the requests.

```bash
# Scan network range
sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24
```
