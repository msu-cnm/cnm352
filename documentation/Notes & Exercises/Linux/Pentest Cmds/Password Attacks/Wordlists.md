## Password Wordlists / Dictionaries

Kali Linux includes several found in `/usr/share/wordlists/`

### Standard Wordlists

1. Create a custom list by scanning a website and grab frequently mentioned words.

   ```bash
   cewl www.megacorpone.com -m 6 -w megacorp-cewl.txt
   
   # Options
   -m 6	# Locates words with minimum of 6 characters
   ```

   These single words would likely not meet requirements of password policies.  You can surmise password policies based on discovered passwords and use that to create a list that satisfies the policy with John the Ripper (JTR).

2. Modify `/etc/john/john.conf` to define the password policy.

   - Look for `# Wordlist mode rules` and append a new rule

     ```bash
     # Wordlist mode rules
     [List.Rules:Wordlist]
     <----SNIPPED----->
     # Try the second half of split passwords
     -s x**
     -s-c x** M l Q
     # Adding in this rule to add two digit numbers to end of password:
     $[0-9]$[0-9]
     
     # Options
     $		# This tells John to append these characters to the original word from wordlist
     [0-9]	# Tells John the type of character to append
     
     # Repeating this just appends a second number
     ```

3. Run John the Ripper to generate the new mutated wordlist

   ```bash
   john --wordlist=megacorp-cewl.txt --rules --stdout >> mutated.txt
   
   # Options
   --wordlist		# The source wordlist
   --rules			# Activate rules in config file
   --stdout		# Output results to stdout
   ```

### Brute Force Wordlists

This can be combined with standard wordlists and password policies to produce a wordlist containing every possible match to a specific password policy.  This can be discovered by comparing passwords found previously.

Crunch can generate brute force wordlists based on specified placeholders.

| Placeholder | Character Translation              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| @           | Lower case alpha character         |
| ,           | Upper case alpha character         |
| %           | Numeric characters                 |
| ^           | Special characters including space |

```bash
crunch 8 8 -t ,@@^^%%%

# Options
8 8		# Defines min and max length, which is exactly 8 chars here
-t ,@@^^%%%	# Defines the pattery to follow
```

Can also specify character sets as well:

```bash
crunch 4 6 0123456789ABCDEF -o crunch.txt

# Options
0123456789ABCDEF	# Passwords will be created using these characters
-o crunch.txt		# List will be output to crunch.txt
```

Crunch also offers predefined characters sets in `/usr/share/crunch/charset.lst`

```bash
crunch 4 6 -f /usr/share/crunch/charset.lst mixalpha -o crunch.txt

# Options
-f /usr/share/crunch/charset.lst mixalph	# Specify path to charset file and the set to use from th file
```

### Managed Wordlists

SecLists - https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists

> SecLists is the security tester's companion. It's a collection of  multiple types of lists used during security assessments, collected in  one place. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, and many more.
