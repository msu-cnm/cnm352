## Nessus - Enterprise Vulnerability Scanner

### Setup

Although Nessus is not available in the Kali repositories, we can manually download the 64-bit .deb file for Kali from the Tenable website: https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus.
We can view the SHA256 checksum value by clicking the “Checksum” link on the download page and validate the downloaded file’s checksum with sha256sum:  

After downloading, install with:

```bash
sudo apt install ./Nessus-X.X.X.deb
```

Then start the service:

```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/nessusd start
```

Once the service has started, visit the webGUI:

```bash
 firefox https://localhost:8834 &
```

Choose 'Nessus Essentials', then fill out the form to have an activation code emailed out.

#### Scans

There are several predefined scan templates.  After selecting a scan template and entering the targets, more granular options can be configured in the settings menu options.

For instance, the Basic scan template only scans common ports, but can be modified to scan all ports using the 'Discovery' section.

##### Scan Types:

- Basic Network Scan - Does a basic port scan using common ports by default
- Credentialed Patch Audit - Supply credentials and scan the packages on the system
- Advanced Scan - This runs without any pre-set options, which is good for custom scans.

#### Plugins

These are specialized scripts that dig deeper during a scan.  These can be selected or deselected under the 'Plugins' tab of the scan configuration.

Plugins are grouped by protocol.  Clicking a group in the left column shows the plugins associated with that group in the right column.  Clicking the name of a plugin shows details on that plugin.  Clicking the 'Disabled/Enabled' button will toggle the plugin status.
