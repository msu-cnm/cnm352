## Nikto - Open Source Web Scanner

Nikto is a highly configurable Open Source web server scanner that tests for thousands of dangerous files and programs, vulnerable server versions and various server configuration issues. 

It performs well, but is not designed for stealth as it will send many requests and embed information about itself in the User-Agent header  

Scans can take several hours to complete depending on the amount of content on the target site.

```bash
nikto -host=http://www.example.com -maxtime=30s

# Options
-maxtime	# Forces the scan to stop after a certain amount of time
-T			# Tune the scan options to specific types of tests
```
