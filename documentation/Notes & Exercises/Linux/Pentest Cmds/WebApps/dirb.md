## DIRB - Web Content Scanner

Uses a custom wordlist to find directories and pages by issuing requests to the server.

Uses a predefined list by default but can be customized, set custom cookies, headers, and more.

```bash
dirb http://www.example.com -r -z 10 -w

# Options
-r	# Scans non-recursively.  By default, dirb will traverse every folder and run the scans within those folders as well.
-z 10	# Adds a 10 millisecond delay to each request
-w		# Scans past warning messages, like 403 errors
```

The non-recursive option speeds up the scan and lets you choose which folders to traverse and scan deeper.

### Cheat Sheet

Grab IP's of anything with http on 80 from a group of greppable nmap files and run dirb against that list:

```bash
for i in $(grep 80/open/tcp//http /home/coyote/oscplab/public/enumeration/nmap-scans/*.gnmap | awk -F ": " '{print $2}' | cut -d " " -f 1); do dirb http://$i -r -o /home/coyote/oscplab/enumeration/dirb/dirb_$i.txt; done;
```
