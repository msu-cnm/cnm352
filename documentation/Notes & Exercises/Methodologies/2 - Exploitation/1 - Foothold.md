## Initial Foothold

Always remember to take things one step at a time.  Don't try to go in several different directions at once.  Focus on the task at hand, one task at a time, making notes for any tangents to explore later.

1. Vulnerability Scanning & Enumeration

   1. Use nmap to scan for open ports, then perform specific protocol scans using tools for those protocols or scripts.
   2. Look up the versions of the services and find vulnerabilities and exploits for those.

2. Exploitation

   1. After executing an exploit, see if you have command output

      - If yes, try an `ls` or `ping` command

      - If no, try getting it to sleep for a few seconds and see if that works.  You will know if your output is delayed by the amount of time you specified (roughly, given time for the response to be generated).  Sometimes you will get no output, sometimes a simple 'success' message.  But this will let you know if you are able to manipulate the output at least.

        ```bash
        # Windows
        timeout 4
        ```

        ```powershell
        # Linux
        sleep 4
        ```

   2. Remember that while executing commands, some services may not have a `PATH` variable set, requiring you to specify the full path to commands.

4. Create your reverse shell connection.

   1. If not using metasploit, DO NOT use staged payloads
   2. Always use verbose mode with netcat to see if a connection is established
   3. REMEMBER TO TELL NETCAT TO RUN A SHELL `-e SHELLCMD`
