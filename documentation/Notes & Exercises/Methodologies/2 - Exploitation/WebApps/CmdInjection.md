### Injection Attacks

1. Identify the format of the URL and any data submitted to the form.  You can use Burpsuite to do this while using the browser or examine the code if you have access to it.

2. Use wfuzz to find bad characters found in `/usr/share/wordlists/wfuzz/Injections/bad_chars.txt`.  Look for changes in lines or major changes in size.  You also may want to try and run a command that generates a large amount of output.

   ```bash
   # Generating jobs using bad_chars.txt
   wfuzz -c -t 1 -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/wfuzz/Injections/bad_chars.txt -d 'ip=FUZZid&send=Ping+It%21' -u https://127.0.0.1:10443/index.php?page=ping.php
   ```

3. If need be, check output pages (if it's a multi-step process)

   ```bash
   # Calculating and generating a list of job numbers
   seq 42 64 > jobs.txt
   
   # Checking the size of the output of the jobs
   wfuzz -c -z file,jobs.txt -u 'https://127.0.0.1:10443/index.php?page=job.php&job=FUZZ'
   ```

4. Try fuzzing different command patterns found in `/usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/command-injection-commix.txt`
