### 18.3.2.1 Exercise
#### 1. Log in to your Debian client as an unprivileged user and attempt to elevate your privileges to root using the above technique.

1. Logged in as student
   ![image-20200724154522370](.18.3.2.1.assets/image-20200724154522370.png)
2. Examined the cron logs to find any interesting scripts & noticed /var/scripts/user_backups.sh is running as root every 5 mins
   ![image-20200724154828696](.18.3.2.1.assets/image-20200724154828696.png)
3. I examine the file permissions of this script and found it is writable by everyone:
   ![image-20200724154855278](.18.3.2.1.assets/image-20200724154855278.png)
4. I added a reverse-shell one-liner to this file, set up a listener on Kali and waited for cron to run the script:
   ![image-20200724154940072](.18.3.2.1.assets/image-20200724154940072.png)
5. Once the job executed, I received a reverse shell as the root user:
   ![image-20200724155023413](.18.3.2.1.assets/image-20200724155023413.png)
   And upgraded to interactive shell:
