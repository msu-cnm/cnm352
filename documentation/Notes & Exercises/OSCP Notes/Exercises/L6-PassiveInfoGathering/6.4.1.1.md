### 6.4.1.1 Exercises
#### 1. Who is the VP of Legal for MegaCorp One and what is their email address?

Name: Mike Carlow
Title: VP Of Legal
Email: mcarlow@megacorpone.com 

#### 2. Use Google dorks (either your own or any from the GHDB) to search www.megacorpone.com for interesting documents.

It appears the items that were supposed to show up are no longer available.  I checked the forums and others were having the same issue.  See:  https://forums.offensive-security.com/showthread.php?29855-6-4-1-1-Exercise-2&highlight=google+dorks

This was evident when the examples in the course document were also not getting the same results as shown in the course document.  However, I did try some searches anyway:

```bash
site:megacorpone.com -ext:html
```

```bash
site:megacorpone.com ext:txt OR ext:pdf OR ext:zip
```
