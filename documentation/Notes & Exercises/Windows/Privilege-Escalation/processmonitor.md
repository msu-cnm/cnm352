## Process Monitor 

From [SysInternalsSuite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite)

Allows you to see what all a process is doing on your system.

- Use the filters to reduce out:
  - By Process Name `Process Name is myrpocess.exe`
  - By Registry edits `Operation contains Reg`
  - By Registry keys that don't exist `Result contains NAME NOT FOUND`
  - File commands `Operation contains file`
  - Path of a file `Path contains \userfolder\`

`CTRL+X` Clears the logs
