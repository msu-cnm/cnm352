## Upgrading Windows Shells

While there is no true way to upgrade a netcat shell, you can wrap your netcat session with `rlwrap `and at least get line editing and command history options (but not tab completion):

Install

```bash
sudo apt install rlwrap
```

Usage - just preface your nc command with `rlwrap`

```bash
# As a server
rlwrap nc -nvlp 8000

# As a client
rlwrap nc -nv 11.1.1.1 80
```

BIG NOTE:  This is still not an truly interactive shell, so you still need to keep that in mind.
