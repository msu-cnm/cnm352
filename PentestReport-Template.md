# Executive Summary

This section is a high level summary of the goals of the pentest.  For labs, you can summarize the objectives here:

- Ex: I had to do task X
- Ex: I needed to test machine Y

A brief summary describing the test is appropriate too, such as 'this test was performed using a provided Kali Linux 2021 VM inside the organization network', which described our NetLab setup.

## Summary of Results

This section gives a summarized but technical overview of the findings.  Break down the findings by system, summarizing each one.  This is only the major findings, not a summary of the entire process.

| System                  | Summary                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 10.250.226.X (HOSTNAME) | This machine was vulnerable to VULNERABILITY X which provided a pathway to root access. |


## Recommendations

1. This is a brief list of what you would do to fix the issues discovered.  This section should not be overly technical.

## Conclusion

The conclusion is your final thoughts on the test and overall opinion of the state of the environment that was tested.

## Risk Rating

An overall risk rating for the environment with justification.

# Methodology

Describe the type of test (black box, crystal box, etc) and the type of access given into the testing environment.

## Organization B (10.250.226.0/24)

### Initial Reconnaissance

1. Describe how you scanned the environment, including the scanning commands and paste summary results.  Don't include entire nmap scan output here, you can put that in the Appendix.

   ```bash
   My scanning commands here.
   ```

### 10.250.226.X - HOSTNAME

1. The steps of how you infiltrated a host would be detailed here.

2. Be sure to include any images of output or anything relevant.

4. Any commands should also be included.  This should basically be a walkthrough someone else can follow step-by-step to reproduce your results.
   
   ```bash
   Some commands here
   ```
   
4. If are after any flags, your screenshot should show both the IP address and the contents of the flag in the <u>same screenshot</u>.

# Appendix A - Vulnerability Detail & Mitigation

## Risk Rating Scale

In accordance with NIST SP 800-30, exploited vulnerabilities are ranked based upon likelihood and impact to determine overall risk.

## Description of Vulnerability

| Rating:      | High                                                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Description: | Overview of the vulnerability                            |
| Impact:      | What could an attacker do with this vulnerability?       |
| Remediation: | How do you remediate it? (config fix, patch, etc)        |
| Applies to:  | Which machine(s) (hostname and IP) did you find this on? |

# Appendix B - nmap Scan Results

Full output of nmap scans

## 10.250.226.X - HOSTNAME

```bash
For each host scanned, provide the entire nmap scan results here
```

# Appendix C - Custom Scripts

## myscript.sh

```bash
If you used any custom scripts necessary to reproduce your results, they can be included here
```

## myscript.sh

```bash
You can also include code here if you made significant modifications to some code (more than 25%)
```
